PyMeeus
=======

    **Library of astronomical algorithms in Python**.

PyMeeus is a Python implementation of the astronomical algorithms
described in the classical book "Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Edition
(1998)" from Jean Meeus.

There are great astronomical libraries out there. For instance, if
you're looking for high precision and speed you should take a look at
`libnova <http://libnova.sourceforge.net/>`__. However, the advantages
of PyMeeus are its simplicity, ease of use, ease of reading, ease of
installation (it has the minimum amount of dependencies), abundant
documentation, and it is written in Python :-).

Contributing
------------

The preferred method to contribute is through forking and pull requests:

1. Fork it (https://github.com/architest/pymeeus/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b feature/fooBar``)
3. Commit your changes (``git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'``)
4. Push to the branch (``git push origin feature/fooBar``)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Please bear in mind that PyMeeus follows the PEP8 style guide for Python
code `(PEP8) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?>`__. We suggest
you install and use a linter like
`Flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__ before contributing.

Additionally, PyMeeus makes heavy use of automatic tests. As a general
rule, every function or method added must have a corresponding test in
the proper place in ``tests`` directory.

Finally, documentation is also a big thing here. Add proper and abundant
documentation to your new code. This also includes in-line comments!!!.
